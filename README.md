# Sarcasm detection in text using Pytroch
This is my course assignment for a machine learning certificate from Jovian.ml. It focuses on training various neural network models for the purposes of detecting sarcasm in text.

I have wrote an accompanying  blog post on Medium for this project:
[Detecting sarcasm in text using Pytorch](https://medium.com/@robisipos/detecting-sarcasm-in-text-using-pytorch-2e1b3c382dfa)

It explains the following topics:
 - exploring and understanding the type of data used
 - explanation for all the preprocessing of the dataset
 - explanation for how the datapipeline works when using Pytorch (especially in conjunction with torchtext)
 - describes in detail the types of models used (Logistic Regression, Feed forward network, Convolutional neural network)
  
  
 If you like it, leave it a clap 👏.
 
 
Special thanks to [Aakash N S](https://medium.com/@aakashns) and the rest of the Jovian.ml crew that made the course possible.

The dataset used in this project was [News Headlines Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rmisra/news-headlines-dataset-for-sarcasm-detection) put together by [Rishabh Misra](https://rishabhmisra.github.io/publications/)
